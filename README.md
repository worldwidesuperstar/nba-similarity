# nba-mbti

## Overview

As someone who has taken the MBTI probably over 10 times (and gotten the same
thing every single submission) and as an avid NBA watcher who cares about
advanced stats, I wanted to leverage data analysis and machine learning to
create MBTI-like "personality types" for NBA players based on their playstyles.
This tool aims to group NBA players from the 2024-25 season into 16 personality
types using K-means clustering and similarity metrics based on their playstyle.

## The Four Basketball Dimensions

### 1. Extroversion (E) vs Introversion (I)

-   **E**: Players that create their own offense via options like pull-up 3s, iso
    plays, taking contested shots, etc. A star that is the main focus in a
    heliocentric offensive system is an extrovert. An extroverted player
    would play on the aggressive side, taking difficult shots very early in
    the shot clock and having a relatively lower assist rate. Extroverted
    players would have higher turnover rates relative to their assists and
    could be seen as "less careful".

           Example: Trae Young (heliocentric star, pullup 3s, on ball player)

-   **I**: Players that focus moreso on facilitating other players and playing
    within a system. Patient players whose shots consist mainly of good
    looks. An introverted player would have higher efficiency and assist
    percentage, and would have more off-ball presence than an extroverted
    player. These players are more cautious (potentially at the cost of
    volume and raw output) and make safer decisions, resulting in less
    turnovers.

           Example: Nikola Jokic (system player, low turnover rate, uses clock)
